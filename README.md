# Monte Carlo Simulation in R

The restaurant profit simulation was part of an experiment carried out to write a thesis on [Advanced Microeconomics] (https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=2400-DS1AMI) in my university. 
Here we can see the codes that helped with the simulation.
